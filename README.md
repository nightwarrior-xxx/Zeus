 ### :cactus: Branches

 I use an agile continuous integration methodology, so the version is frequently updated and development is really fast.

1. **`dev`** is the development branch.

2. **`master`** is the production branch.

**Steps to work with feature branch**

1. To start working on a new feature, create a new branch prefixed with `FEATURE` and followed by feature name. (ie. `FEATURE-<feature name>`)
2. Once you are done with your changes, you can raise PR.

**Steps to create a pull request**

1. Make a PR to `dev` branch.
2. Comply with the best practices and guidelines e.g. where the PR concerns visual elements it should have an image showing the effect.

After this, changes will be merged.

### :exclamation: Guideline
